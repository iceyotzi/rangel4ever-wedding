### Step 4: Update Your Website Code

1. Open `src/index.html`
2. Find line 278 (search for `SHEET_GID`):
   ```javascript
   const FAQS_CSV_URL = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS2oAMBT5LlO-tU1rh_APIM5SRwQ1L7aJ49D7kdjBjLJXiF6gD8ErpYVnY4oJ5nLWvazIPl-vCwNXYl/pub?gid=SHEET_GID&output=csv';
   ```
3. Replace `SHEET_GID` with your actual GID number from Step 2:
   ```javascript
   const FAQS_CSV_URL = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS2oAMBT5LlO-tU1rh_APIM5SRwQ1L7aJ49D7kdjBjLJXiF6gD8ErpYVnY4oJ5nLWvazIPl-vCwNXYl/pub?gid=123456789&output=csv';
   ```

## üìä Sheet Structure

### Your Google Sheet Should Have 2 Tabs:

#### Tab 1: Schedule (or Sheet1)
| title | description | date | time | order |
|-------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| Event 1 | Description | Date | Time | 1 |

#### Tab 2: FAQs
| id | question | answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Question text? | Answer text |

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Two separate CSV exports:**
   - Schedule: First sheet (default)
   - FAQs: Second sheet (with `gid` parameter)

2. **Both load independently:**
   - Schedule loads into Schedule section
   - FAQs load into FAQ section
   - Each has its own loading/error states

3. **Updates are instant:**
   - Edit either sheet
   - Refresh website
   - Changes appear immediately!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### FAQs not loading?

1. **Check the GID:**
   - Make sure you replaced `SHEET_GID` with actual number
   - Check the URL in your browser when on FAQs tab

2. **Verify sheet is published:**
   - File ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Publish to web
   - Make sure FAQs sheet is selected and published as CSV

3. **Check sheet name:**
   - Sheet must be named exactly as you published it
   - Case-sensitive!

4. **Test the URL directly:**
   - Copy your FAQS_CSV_URL from the code
   - Paste in browser
   - Should show comma-separated data

5. **Check browser console (F12):**
   - Look for error messages
   - Check Network tab for the CSV request

### Schedule works but FAQs don't?

- The FAQs sheet GID is probably wrong or not published
- Double-check Step 2 and Step 3 above
