## üîç Troubleshooting

### Formatting not showing?

**Check your syntax:**
- Bold: `**text**` (two asterisks on each side)
- Italic: `*text*` (one asterisk on each side)
- Links: `[text](url)` (square brackets for text, parentheses for URL)

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `*bold*` ‚Üí Should be `**bold**`
- ‚ùå `[link] (url)` ‚Üí No space: `[link](url)`
- ‚ùå `**bold*` ‚Üí Must have matching asterisks: `**bold**`

### Links not clickable?

- Make sure URL includes `http://` or `https://`
- Example: `[click here](https://example.com)` ‚úÖ
- Not: `[click here](example.com)` ‚ùå

### Line breaks not working?

- Use `Alt+Enter` (Windows) or `Option+Enter` (Mac) within the cell
- Don't just type `\n` - it won't work

### Changes not appearing?

- Google Sheets caches CSV for a few minutes
- Hard refresh your browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Wait 2-3 minutes after editing the sheet
